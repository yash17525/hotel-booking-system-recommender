# hotel-booking-system-recommender
### In this project, following things were done to build a Hotel Booking and Recommender System :
* I have taken hotel data from a json file. It contained basic identifying fields but those very  not enough for making a recommender. So, I created some pseudo data about the facilities provided by the hotels and their price.
* I created a few users who can book a hotel or save the draft of their details if they want to pay later.
* Navigation bar contains tabs such as Home, Booking, signup, login, user dashboard, admin section , Recommended. 
* Under Booking sections user will be able to view all the list of hotels and he can book a room in one of them. 
* Under user dashboard section we can view the drafts. User is also able to view previous bookings under dashboard section. Before making a payment , user gets the   option to save details and pay later. 
* In admin section , the administrator can view all the bookings done by different users and can also perform user check-out.
* Under recommended section, user will be able to view recommended hotels. User will also see recommended tag to those hotels which are recommended to him under booking section.
